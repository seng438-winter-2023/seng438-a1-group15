# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

For the exploratory testing of the ATM simulation, we will target the specific transaction interactions with the actor and the ATM system, these include:
-   Valid, invalid, and negative inputs to the input field of number of 20 dollar bills when we insert the card.(Integers, floats and negative numbers.)
-   Valid (Card # 1 and 2) and invalid input (any other user input) for the card number that are registered on the ATM.
-   Valid and Invalid input for PINS, that is each card registered for each account should only have 1 PIN associated with it. The digit
length does not necessarily matter as long as it is the correct PIN.
-   Testing each transaction option extensively, checking every option to see if for example the amount of money withdraw using option 1, which is $20 does display $20 on the GUI or not, and likewise the receipt log displays the correct amount withdrawn.
-   As well as establishing links to two types of transactions. For example transfering money from a chequing to savings account, and checking to see if the second registered account can access the same cash.
-   Briefly testing the take receipt and balance inquiry features as they are simply just a push of a button to display or delete the text from the receipt text window.

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
